/**
 * A reference-counted object that requires explicit deallocation.
 * <p>
 * When a new {@link ReferenceCounted} is instantiated, it starts with the reference count of {@code 1}.
 * {@link #retain()} increases the reference count, and {@link #release()} decreases the reference count.
 * If the reference count is decreased to {@code 0}, the object will be deallocated explicitly, and accessing
 * the deallocated object will usually result in an access violation.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If an object that implements {@link ReferenceCounted} is a container of other objects that implement
 * {@link ReferenceCounted}, the contained objects will also be released via {@link #release()} when the container's
 * reference count becomes 0.
 * </p>
 *
 * 需要显式释放位置的引用计数对象。
 *
 * 当实例化一个新的{@link ReferenceCounted}时，它从{@code 1}的引用计数开始。{@link #retain()}增加引用计数，而{@link #release()}
 * 减少引用计数。如果引用计数减少到{@code 0}，则显式地释放对象，并且访问释放对象通常会导致访问冲突。
 *
 * 如果实现{@link ReferenceCounted}的对象是实现{@link ReferenceCounted}的其他对象的容器，那么当容器的引用计数变为0时，所包含的对象
 * 也将通过{@link #release()}释放。
